# ⚖️ **Sperm Court: Guilty Until Proven Fertile**  
### *Your sperm. In the dock. Facing justice. No mercy.*

*One click. One objection. One lifetime of shame.*

</div>

## The Idea That Shouldn’t Work (But Does)

> **Men ignore fertility.**  
> **Sperm Racing** made testing fun.  
> **We made it a courtroom.**  

**After your $99 Sperm Racing kit scan:**  
Your sperm **stand trial** — **in 3D** — **wearing a tiny white wig**.  
You? The **prosecutor**.  
Your weapon?  
> **ONE GIANT YELLOW BUTTON: `OBJECTION!`**

## What Actually Happens (Weird. Real. Unforgiving.)

```mermaid

    A[Race Complete] --> B[Courtroom Opens]

    E --> F[Sperm SHAKES. Wig FLIES. Confetti EXPLODES.]
    F --> G["Verdict: 4/5 GUILTY"]
    G --> H["Sentence: Life in the Left Testicle"]
    H --> I[Future Child: "Dad, I could've been a lawyer..."]
